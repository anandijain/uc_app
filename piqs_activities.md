Please describe how you have prepared for your intended major, including your readiness to succeed in your upper-division courses once you enroll at the university.

One day, as a software engineer at JuliaHub, a company specializing in software for computational sciences, I received clinical time-series data tracking patients’ tumor volumes. Until this point, I was content with computational science as a career and as a sufficient method for understanding and solving complex problems.

This was the first time I had a visceral reaction to my work. I was shocked that something as high level as tumor volume was being modeled. It wasn’t just abstract molecule concentrations. My task was to optimize the drug dosing schedule to minimize tumor volume after five years. 

I would never meet any of these patients and I didn’t even know their names, but I felt a connection to them as I watched the simulations predicting their next five years of life flash on my screen. The broader picture of this work became clear—proteins, cells, tissues, and humans are all machines. We can intervene and design entirely new solutions outside the scope of evolutionary history to solve the challenges that face humanity—food insecurity, climate change, disease; the list is endless.

I became disillusioned with my narrow view of engineering, which had been limited to software systems that alone are not capable of solving these challenges. The tools that humanity uses to study the universe are physical devices. I had little understanding of what goes into designing and manufacturing scientific equipment—like that which is used to estimate tumor volume. If I wanted to have an impact, I would need to understand more than just software engineering. Through my personal projects and coursework at De Anza College, I became increasingly experienced in mechanical design, electronics, and machining.

I have gained a deep appreciation for all fields of engineering and a fascination for the vast unexplored areas of bioengineering research and application. My expertise in computational science and hands-on engineering projects has prepared me to succeed as a bioengineer capable of tackling rigorous course material and detailed lab experiments. 

I am excited to sit at a lab bench, pipette until dawn, fall asleep, and dream of building an open-source liquid handling robot.






Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.

Live streaming is my favorite activity. In fact, 1287 people have tuned in to watch me write this essay.

Over the past 6 years, I've streamed over 900 hours producing music, sharing my experiences and connecting with others, and solving months-long projects, like building a modular synthesizer from scratch. For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated by the questions: “What do people do?”, “How do they do it?”, and “Why do they make the choices they make?”.

Streaming allows me to express my personal answers to these questions and provide others with what I wish I had as a kid, an unedited view into the creative processes and problem solving strategies of the world’s best engineers.

Since starting streaming, I've grown to be more ambitious, more dedicated, and more willing to attempt things outside of my comfort zone because I’ve learned that facing new challenges is the exciting part of the stream. Encouragement from others was a big factor in believing in myself enough to start my most recent project—a face-tracking Nerf ball shooter that I designed and built from scratch.

I didn’t have any experience with computer aided design or 3D printing, but the joy that I get from sharing the challenge with others enables me to persevere through a long road of designing, failing, and redesigning, until I have something that works. 

When I started, I never would have guessed that strangers all over the world would devote their time to helping me. During a project replicating the Mathematica programming language, a viewer named Oleh from Poland spent three hours reviewing my code live on stream. Since then, Oleh has become a good friend and active member of my Discord community. 

As I transition to bioengineering, I want to continue using my channel to inspire the next generation of bioengineers. I believe bioengineering has the biggest potential to solve the challenges facing our species, so it’s crucial that we educate others and build a diverse community of people to participate. Streaming will be a role I play in this community.


Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?

Upon starting at UChicago, I quickly became overwhelmed by the freedom to choose how to spend my time. I became engrossed in my hobbies of producing music and training machine learning models on historical sports data.

I lost sight of the amazing educational opportunity and grew discouraged by my waning passion and lack of success in academics. I yearned for applied courses in a school that prides itself on theory and humanities. I was unfocused in the few applied courses I did take. This frustration reached its peak during Spring 2020. 

While others were manufacturing vaccines, simulating virus spread, and designing more efficacious masks, I felt I had nothing to offer. I was still passionate about the research I did for an internship the prior year. I took a gap year to pursue independent study in computational science. I became obsessed with nonlinear dynamics, differential equations, and systems biology.

I reconnected with the Julia language Slack group I joined during my internship. People in the community became friends and mentors. I was introduced to an online MIT course on “Parallel Computing and Scientific Machine Learning” taught by the director of modeling and simulation at JuliaHub. 


I took the course and found the community to be willing to devote time to ensuring I understood the material, even though I wasn’t officially enrolled. My passion and skill for the material stood out. The instructor offered me a full-time position working on systems biology at JuliaHub. I instantly felt at-home, where the work was collaborative and the projects felt consequential and challenging. I regained my confidence that there were places I could thrive and have a positive impact.

Since working in industry and re-enrolling and excelling in community college, I’ve realized that taking that gap year was the best thing I could have done. I have gained the maturity and focus that I was lacking at UChicago. The road I took was unconventional, but I feel more confident about my future as a bioengineer than I’ve felt about anything in my life. 


What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?

In the summer of 2019, I started UCQuantum, an undergraduate organization devoted to quantum computing, after realizing the tremendous potential impact quantum computing could have on society. 

UChicago had recently launched the Chicago Quantum Exchange, a consortium of national laboratories and local universities to facilitate collaboration in quantum sciences. However, undergraduates were largely left out of this initiative, primarily intended for faculty and graduate students.

Professors were excited about the prospect of having an organization devoted to their field, and lent valuable advice on how to grow. Over the course of Autumn 2019, our social media presence grew, and professors shared our activities with their circles. After being approved at the beginning of Winter 2020, we quickly began planning activities and recruiting new members. One particularly unforgettable experience was organizing and touring a real superconducting quantum computer in David Schuster’s lab. 

When the club moved online in Spring 2020, we kept our community connected by hosting journal clubs on Zoom. Being able to stay in touch with my group of quantum friends was particularly valuable to me during Covid; I think it was for others as well.

The club has since toured Argonne National Laboratory, hosted numerous talks and hackathons, and collaborated on qubit simulation software with Stanford University. In the Slack group I started with just two friends, there are now 221 members and alumni who have participated in UCQuantum. I can’t take credit for these amazing achievements, but I did learn that sometimes a small spark is all that is needed to sow the seed for future generations to nurture and grow. 

During those initial meetings, when we hoped people would show up and no one did, we dreamt of having a community like what exists now. Looking back, I’ve realized how valuable having a long term perspective is when it comes to building a community.

I am still fascinated by the promise of quantum computing; though now I hope to join or start a community for biological engineers and compete in the International Genetically Engineered Machines competition.
