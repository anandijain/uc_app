requirements for transfer 

biggest thing is phys2/3, DE, Chem2/3 orgo1

s2025 de anza:
* EM physics 
* differential equations
* chem2 need to check ap credits for ap chem 

## two options since i cant find what historically has been offered in summer
summer2025? 
* chem 3 
* physics 3 

f2025
* ochem1 

w2026
* ochem2 

alt if i cant take chem 3 in summer then i have to get into another campus for ochem 2 
but it doesnt seem strictly necesary
