    * maybe just make a new repo 
* somewhere in app need to mention im a machinist 
* find out if even though grades aren't going to be out for de anza at submission time, if theyll get them 
    - reason: need them to see that my academic performance has turned around 
* reach out to professors at davis, berkeley
