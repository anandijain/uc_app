REQUIRED 
Please describe how you have prepared for your intended major, including your readiness to succeed in your upper-division courses once you enroll at the university

* research biology at ucb and see what courses i can take and a possible track 

strong computational background in systems modeling of large ODEs

* do some analysis of how many hours ive streamed since the start of cas3 
* make a github pages 
* add an angle for an interest in science communication and filmography 

Live streaming the engineering process is my favorite activity. Over the past year and a half I have streamed the creation of three projects that I am proud of. The first was writing a small replica of Mathematica capable of backtracking pattern matching, simulating cellular automata, and doing symbolic differentiation of arbitrary expressions. The second was building a modular synthesizer from scratch by designing a voltage controlled oscillator, a voltage controlled filter, and a power supply, then manually etching and soldering the PCBs myself. The third project is a stepper motor controlled [ideally i could claim face tracking] two rotational axis nerf ball shooter. 

These projects have made me a more confident and capable engineer and have broadened my horizons for the     field of engineering. In paticular, the synthesizer and nerf shooter were far outside of my area of expertise. I had never used a CAD program nor EDA, but I discovered a deep love for them. There are a lot of connections to software design in how a part or assembly is made in CAD or circuit in EDA.  

notable challenges overcome 
* cas3 - adding BlankSequence and BlankNullSequence 
* synth - first mechanical-ish like project. 1) overcoming the fear of it of something that took a long time either a) not working or b) breaking something. 2) electronics debugging - very different than software
* nerf - inevitably you need to redesign and even with parametric modeling its still a very tough task. usually easier to just start from scratch almost. - planning ahead for what may go wrong. example: not enough torque in tilt angle

I have always been interested in biology, but the discipline has only started to be one suited for engineers.
