# uc_app

my application as a transfer student to become a synthetic biologist 

todo: 
* research biology at ucb and see what courses i can take and a possible track 
* do some analysis of how many hours ive streamed since the start of cas3 
* make a playlist for the nerf devlog
* link the nerf devlog in github pages  
* rename the repo and clean up the code for fusion models? 
    * maybe just make a new repo 
* somewhere in app need to mention im a machinist 
* find out if even though grades aren't going to be out for de anza at submission time, if theyll get them 
    - reason: need them to see that my academic performance has turned around 
done: 
* make a github pages

Live streaming the engineering process is my favorite activity. Over the past year and a half I have streamed the creation of three projects that I am proud of. The first was writing a small replica of Mathematica capable of backtracking pattern matching, simulating cellular automata, and doing symbolic differentiation of arbitrary expressions. The second was building a modular synthesizer from scratch by designing a voltage controlled oscillator, a voltage controlled filter, and a power supply, then manually etching and soldering the PCBs myself. The third project is a stepper motor controlled [ideally i could claim face tracking] two rotational axis nerf ball shooter. 

These projects have made me a more confident and capable engineer and have broadened my horizons for the     field of engineering. In paticular, the synthesizer and nerf shooter were far outside of my area of expertise. I had never used a CAD program nor EDA, but I discovered a deep love for them. There are a lot of connections to software design in how a part or assembly is made in CAD or circuit in EDA.  

notable challenges overcome - 2 categories specific to project and general 
* cas3 - adding BlankSequence and BlankNullSequence 
* synth - first mechanical-ish like project. 1) overcoming the fear of it of something that took a long time either a) not working or b) breaking something. 2) electronics debugging - very different than software
* nerf - inevitably you need to redesign and even with parametric modeling its still a very tough task. usually easier to just start from scratch almost. - planning ahead for what may go wrong. example: not enough torque in tilt angle
* the general tension between being stuck on something and not wanting to share or admit i'm stuck. and training the brain to realize that the failures are fine 
* starting from scratch - cas3-cas8 
I have always been interested in biology, but the discipline has only started to be one suited for engineers. 





Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?

Spring quarter of 2020 was difficult for me emotionally. I was far away from family and the isolation was getting to me. The things that I've always been passionate about were harder to get excited about. After that quarter, I decided to take a year off of school. During that year, I fell in love with differential equations and chaotic systems. I read three books that changed my life: "Chaos: Making a New Science" by James Gleick, "A New Kind of Science" by Stephen Wolfram, and "Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos" by Steven Strogatz. During this time, my then-future boss was teaching an online course at MIT on "Parallel Computing and Scientific Machine Learning" which I decided to informally take. I used the Julia programming language Slack community to help me with tough problems and learned a lot about the efficient simulation of large differential equation systems.

This eventually led to the instructor, Chris, offering me a job to move to Boston and work on the Julia differential equations ecosystem.

- did consulting work for some of the worlds biggest pharma for preclinical modeling. efficiently simulating 

- grew to desire doing more actual biology or "real"/phsyical engineering. just doing computational modeling felt like I was missing out. this led me to leaving and learning electrical and mechanical engineering, and now bio 


What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?

Since 2018, I have been very interested in quantum computing. In 2019, I decided to start the Quantum Computing club at UChicago. It was a great deal of work learning to organize people and delegate to others. It is still one of my most proud things I've done because I still get the emails from the club on their current activities, despite my having no involvement in it anymore. I am very proud that I was able to start something that survived beyond me, and has grown so much larger than when it was just me and a couple of friends I forced to be there. 

Since 2021, I have been following the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition. I have always wanted to somehow participate and be on a team. I feel like either starting or joining a team would be a very rewarding experience. I think I have a lot to offer an iGEM team and whereever I end up
